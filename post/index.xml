      <description>The first post with Hugo This Sunday morning I woke up early and I decided to try if I can put together a static website with Hugo and publish it with Github pages. I had been thinking about this for about a year now, since I read some articles about it. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in making very fast loading sites, which are also simple under the hood. I also wanted to make a site where I can publish my thoughts without the noise of social networking sites.</description>
