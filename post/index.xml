      <description>Today is a my own personal Independence Day. Two years ago on this day, I started a new life.
What lead up to this point is that I had a dream of making a difference in the world &amp;amp; gave up everything for it. But after a year, I had to realize that every one of my goals were thoroughly blocked and I was mired down in rules, regulations - written, spoken and un-spoken ones.</description>

      <description>The first post with Hugo This Sunday morning I woke up early and I decided to try if I can put together a static website with Hugo and publish it with Github pages. I had been thinking about this for about a year now, since I read some articles about it. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in making very fast loading sites, which are also simple under the hood. I also wanted to make a site where I can publish my thoughts without the noise of social networking sites.</description>
