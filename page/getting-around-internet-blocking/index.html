<p>Shortly after I moved to Russia, I experienced problems accessing websites and services.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an active Internet censorship in Russia which sometimes uses brute force methods to take down sites and services they deem not fit for Russian eyes. This includes blocking large ranges of IP addresses and sometimes certain ports. For example they tried to block Telegram by blocking all the IP addresses for a hosting service that they used. Telegram easily got around this and it continues to work in Russia. But they kept the blocking, and as I found out when I tried to check out the Elm programming language. It just wouldn&rsquo;t compile because it tried to download something from a server that was being blocked by Russians. And regular sites like jw.org or linkedin.com are also blocked for various political reasons.</p>
<p>To make matters worse blocking happens in the other direction too. Online services block access if accessed with Russian IP address. This includes my banking site (Capital One). And my ex-hosting, 1AND1 IONOS, which blocked SSH access from my computer - and it was sneaky about it too. Instead of showing an Access Denied message, it held the connection open without allowing any traffic. So, it just hung up almost indefinitely.</p>
<p>Fortunately, before coming here, I set up an Ubuntu based Linux server at the company I work for, and also had a remote access set up to it.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks of Googling around and trying differrent things, I figured out how to set up a Proxy which worked for my email, browser and a couple of other programs that honored the Proxy settings.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, by accident, read a blog post from a Chinese student who also experienced the stupidity of internet censorship, and gave me the last piece of the puzzle to make any program working via the proxy, if needed.</p>
<p>Here is my setup. Setting up the proxy via a Linux server. No special setup is needed on the server, it only needs to have an SSH access. Which is pretty common and these days many hosting services provide that on their servers.</p>
<p>NOTE: my computer is also Linux, so if you are using Windows these instructions won&rsquo;t work.</p>

ssh -D <span style="color:#ae81ff">4242</span> -f -C -q -N userName@$PXSRV

</code></pre></div><p>This creates a SOCKS5 proxy at 127.0.0.1 at port 4242. Which you can configure in the system wide or application specific Proxy.</p>
<p>Now, the last piece of the puzzle was a little tool called <code>proxychains</code> which channels all traffic through the proxy for the specified program you are running.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an article that gives more details on it, and how to set it up. In Ubuntu <code>proxychains</code> can be installed with the usual <code>sudo apt install proxychains</code> command.</p>
