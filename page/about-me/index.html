      <p>I think I have a pretty tough time with this one.</p>
<p>We have good ways to describe objects in the physical universe but persons are trickier to do. The mind and spirit are pretty intangible entities. So, all I can do is to describe things about me.</p>
<p>I think the most important trait I have is that I am a seeker of knowledge. Pretty much everything interests me but I prefer to know things which are useful, have some kind of practical purpose.</p>
<p>I experiment a lot. I try new things all the time. I&rsquo;m never satisfied with settling down and doing one thing one way always. This mentality is fit well with my profession as a programmer. And it doesn&rsquo;t fit so well with some of the jobs I&rsquo;ve tried in the past which required sticking to a rigid set of rules.</p>
<p>Another trait I have is thinking differently than pretty much anybody else. Everybody who I&rsquo;ve been associated with told me this at some point or other. Sometimes using words such as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;. However, here this word is not used in a sense of being senselessly destructive or antisocial. I&rsquo;m the polar opposite of these things. Wherever I go, I work hard at improving things and I have friends all over the world who are always glad to see me or hear from me.</p>
<p>Because I think differently, I have a lot of invention ideas. I have a big one that I&rsquo;ve been polishing for years now. It&rsquo;s about re-thinking the whole world of software. I plan to post that here in the not too distant future. As soon as I came to grips with this Hugo system.</p>
<p>One of my guiding principles is simplicity. I found that whenever I encounter something that is more complicated than it needs to be then there are always ways to accomplish the same thing in a simpler way. In programming, this is especially useful. I keep looking for tools, frameworks, programming languages which make my work and production simpler. And I am very glad to see that things are moving in the direction of less complexity and more consistency, in general.</p>
