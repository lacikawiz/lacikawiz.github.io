      <title>A Very Ironic Trump Ad</title>

      <description>This morning I was checking out the Coronavirus statistics and when I got to the USA page I was greeted with this abomination of an ad (see below).
It&amp;rsquo;s a Trump campaign ad asking for a rating on his job performance. Well, the numbers below his picture pretty well describe his job performance. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty obviously dismal, beyond comparision.
The COVID-19 cases are again in a steep uptrend after this idiot urged everybody to open up, when there has never been an actual &amp;amp; necessary lock-down.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a little fun story of my adventure today.
We ordered a printer online. Which didn&amp;rsquo;t come on time and only after some nudging I found out that it actually did arrive but the delivery company just forgot to inform us.
So, I came home for lunch. It&amp;rsquo;s Saturday, and just happen to think about picking up the printer. So I looked up the place on the map. And it said, it&amp;rsquo;s closing at 3pm and won&amp;rsquo;t open until Monday.</description>

      <title>HostWay - probably the most outdated web host provider</title>

      <description>Today, I migrated a WordPress site from the staging area under my own hosting to my client&amp;rsquo;s hosting (HostWay).
The old site was running on some PHP 5-something. Their control panel is a home made one with hardly any CSS, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t give me an option to change the PHP version. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty standard feature on most hostings. So, I contacted tech support via chat and asked them to upgrade it.</description>

      <title>Progress on Figuring out Hugo&#39;s template system</title>

      <description>Today, finally I managed to get the page showing the way I originally envisioned.
I wanted to have the links on the left sidebar to be the content from the /content/pages/ folder, while the list on the right (main) section on the home page to show only the pages from the /content/posts/ folder. Just like a regular blog.
The trick lied in modifying two template files: layouts/_default/baseof.html and layouts/_default/list.html
The first is the overall template for the whole site.</description>

      <description>I think I have a pretty tough time with this one.
We have good ways to describe objects in the physical universe but persons are trickier to do. The mind and spirit are pretty intangible entities. So, all I can do is to describe things about me.
I think the most important trait I have is that I am a seeker of knowledge. Pretty much everything interests me but I prefer to know things which are useful, have some kind of practical purpose.</description>

      <description>About 2 weeks ago, I read an article about the programming language Rust has won the most loved language in Stackoverflow survery for 2020. For 5 years in a row.
It was about 5 years ago when I looked into Go (Golang) and at that time I read a bunch of comparisions between Go and Rust. And somehow, I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up trying it. Go was great and ended up building many tools with it.</description>

      <title>Getting Around Internet Blocking</title>

      <description>Shortly after I moved to Russia, I experienced problems accessing websites and services.
There&amp;rsquo;s an active Internet censorship in Russia which sometimes uses brute force methods to take down sites and services they deem not fit for Russian eyes. This includes blocking large ranges of IP addresses and sometimes certain ports. For example they tried to block Telegram by blocking all the IP addresses for a hosting service that they used.</description>

      <description>Glossary of term that I use on this site This is collection of the definitions of words that I use on this site and might be unfamiliar to the readers.
Hugo This is a piece of software that allows me to generate this site from a couple of text based files and configurations.
It generates the pages of this site as static pages. That means that the pages are stored in files that are ready to be used by your browser.</description>

      <description>Today is a my own personal Independence Day. Two years ago on this day, I started a new life.
What lead up to this point is that I had a dream of making a difference in the world &amp;amp; gave up everything for it. But after a year, I had to realize that every one of my goals were thoroughly blocked and I was mired down in rules, regulations - written, spoken and un-spoken ones.</description>

      <title>My Fist Post with Hugo</title>

      <description>The first post with Hugo This Sunday morning I woke up early and I decided to try if I can put together a static website with Hugo and publish it with Github pages. I had been thinking about this for about a year now, since I read some articles about it. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in making very fast loading sites, which are also simple under the hood. I also wanted to make a site where I can publish my thoughts without the noise of social networking sites.</description>
